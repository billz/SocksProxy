# SocksProxy Plugin
This plugin adds SOCKS v5 proxy server support to RaspAP.

## Installation
The SocksProxy plugin may be installed from RaspAP's **System > Plugins** tab. The `PluginInstaller` automates installing dependencies, creating a non-privileged `danteuser`, adding permissions and so on.

## What's it good for?
A SOCKS v5 proxy is a networking tool that acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. More info [here](https://wiki.debian.org/SOCKS).
